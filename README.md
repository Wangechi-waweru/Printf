This is a printf project collaboration between Praise Waweru and Lynn Waweru.

#_printf.c: converts inputs into characters and strings(produces output according to a format).

#_print_ints.c: has 4 functions. Prints an integer, an unsigned integer, loops through an integer and prints all its digits. The last one returns the number of digits in an integer.

#print_bases.c: has 4 functions. Prints a number in hexadecimal base in lowercase, in uppercase, base 2 and in base 8.

#write_func.c: has 2 functions. Writes a character to stdout and prints a string to stdout.

#print_custom.c: has 4 functions. Prints a string in reverse, prints a string using rot13, prints a percent and non-printable characters.

#print_address.c: prints address of input in hexa format.

#converter.c: converts number and base into a string.

#get_print.c: selects the right printing function depending on the conversion specifier passed to printf.

#main.h: Header file containing all the prototype functions used in this project.

#print_alpha.c: has 2 functions. One loops through a string and prints every character, the other one prints a character.
